            applicable data protection laws.
          </p>
          <p>
            In particular, we may transfer your personal data to the RocketGroup
            LLC which operates MailChimp which is a marketing service. This
            service provider is subscribed to the EU-U.S Privacy Shield and any
            transfers of personal data are carried out on the basis of this
            adequacy decision.
          </p>
          <h2>7. Data security</h2>
          <p>
            We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your
            personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an
            unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access
            to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and
            other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only
            process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject
            to a duty of confidentiality.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal
            data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a
            breach where we are legally required to do so.
          </p>
          <h2>8. Data retention</h2>
          <h3>8.1 How long will you use my personal data for?</h3>
          <p>
            We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to
            fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes
            of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we
            consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data,
            the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of
            your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal
            data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means,
            and the applicable legal requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            By law we have to keep basic information about our customers,
            including contact details and details regarding any contracts which
            you may have entered into as a result of our Services for six years
            after the conclusion of the contract, taking into account the
            applicable prescriptive period at law. We may also retain certain
            personal data to ensure compliance with our legal obligations. In
            particular, we shall retain certain transactional and financial
            information for a period not exceeding ten years, in compliance with
            tax and accounting reporting legal obligations.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some circumstances, we may anonymise your personal data (so that
            it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical
            purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely
            without further notice to you.
          </p>
          <h2>9. Your legal rights</h2>
          <p>
            Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection
            laws in relation to your personal data. Under applicable data
            protection laws, you are entitled to exercise the following rights:
          </p>
          <h3>9.1 You have the right to</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly
            known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to
            receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check
            that we are lawfully processing it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we
            hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or
            inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to
            verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables
            you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no
            good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right
            to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have
            successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see
            below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or
            where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with
            local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply
            with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will
            be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we
            are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and
            there is something about your particular situation which makes you
            want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts
            on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to
            object where we are processing your personal data for direct
            marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have
            compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which
            override your rights and freedoms.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal
            data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your
            personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to
            establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is
            unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us
            to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to
            establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected
            to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have
            overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
          </p>
          <p>
            You also have the right to object to profiling and analysis of your
            preferences.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you
            or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you
            have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used,
            machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to
            automated information which you initially provided consent for us to
            use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying
            on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not
            affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you
            withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be
            able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise
            you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

          <p>
            You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to
            exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a
            reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or
            excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request
            in these circumstances.
          </p>
          <h3>9.3 What we may need from you</h3>
          <p>
            We may need to request specific information from you to help us
            confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal
            data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security
            measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person
            who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you
            for further information in relation to your request to speed up our
            response.
          </p>
          <h3>9.4 Time limit to respond</h3>
          <p>
            We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
            Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is
            particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this
            case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

            <strong>Google Web Fonts</strong>:&nbsp;For uniform representation
            of fonts, this page uses web fonts provided by Google. When you open
            a page, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser
            cache to display texts and fonts correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this purpose, your browser has to establish a direct connection
            to Google servers. Google thus becomes aware that our web page was
            accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web fonts is done in
            the interest of a uniform and attractive presentation of our plugin.
            This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f)
            DSGVO.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font is used
            by your computer.
